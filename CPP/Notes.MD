# üñ•Ô∏è C++ Knowledge Base

This repository is a collection of small C++ programs, examples, and problem-solving exercises.  
The goal is to deepen my foundational and technical understanding of C++, while documenting everything I learn along the way.  

You‚Äôll find:
- Foundational concepts explained through code
- Interesting problems I‚Äôve solved and their solutions
- Notes on C++ features, syntax, and best practices

Think of this repo as my personal knowledge hub for C++ ‚Äî a place to track progress, revisit tricky topics, and showcase my growth as a developer.  
It also serves as a resource I can share with recruiters or collaborators to demonstrate both my coding ability and my approach to continuous learning.

### ‚ö° Note on AI Usage
While I use AI tools daily and believe they are incredibly helpful, the intention of this repository is to minimize reliance on them when working through these problems. The goal is to strengthen my foundations as an engineer by diving deeper into the language and truly understanding the underlying concepts. AI will always be there as a support tool, but this repo is about building the core knowledge first.

### üí° Philosophy
I believe that strong engineering comes from mastering the fundamentals. Tools and frameworks evolve, but the core principles of programming and problem-solving stay the same.  
This repository is my way of:
- Practicing deliberate, hands-on learning  
- Building intuition for how things work under the hood  
- Documenting progress in a way that others (and future me) can benefit from  

By focusing on fundamentals, I aim to become a better problem-solver, not just a better tool-user.
